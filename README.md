# Soft-Computing

This project contains solutions for soft-computing subject labs.

##Task 0 Linear Neuron

Main purpose of this task was artificial neuron model implementation. Simple neuron is activated by identity function and is it trained using **Delta 
principle** so called: *backward propagation of error*. Task should prove that neural network is trained correctly for equation set with exactly one solution.

##Task 1 MADALINE Network

Objective of this exercise was to implement Multiple Adaptive Linear (MADALINE) network which is able to recognize letter patterns. Letters are implemented 
as arrays of 0 and 1 which corresponds respectively to white and black pixel. Each neuron has fixed weights which are **not** trained during network 
execution. Result of MADALINE network execution are neuron outputs. Neuron with highest output value which can be <0,1> is chosen as recognized letter. 
Package training_set_letters/letters.py contains patterns for letters wchich can be recognized.
