# Soft-Computing

This project contains solutions for soft-computing subject labs.

##Task 0

Main purpose of this task was artificial neuron model implementation. Simple neuron is activated by identity function and is it trained using **Delta 
principle** so called: *backward propagation of error*. Task should prove that neural network is trained correctly for equation set with exactly one solution.
